Synchronous environment
• Reliable communication channel
• Fully Connected Network
• Receivers always know the identity of the Senders

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance

The replicas move through a succession of configurations,
known as views
• One replica in a view is considered as the primary (works like a
leader), and others are considered backups
• The primary proposes a value (similar to the Proposers in
Paxos), and the backups accept the value (similar to the Paxos
Acceptors)
• When the primary is detected as faulty, the view is changed –
PBFT elects a new primary and a new view is initiated
• Every view is identified by a unique integer v
• Only the messages from the current view is accepted
